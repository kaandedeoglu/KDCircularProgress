`KDCircularProgress` is a circular progress view written in Swift. It makes it possible to have gradients in the progress view, along with glows and animations. 

KDCircularProgress also has `IBInspectable` and `IBDesignable` support, so you can configure and preview inside the `Interface Builder`. 

Here's an example

```swift
let progress = KDCircularProgress(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
progress.startAngle = -90
progress.progressThickness = 0.2
progress.trackThickness = 0.7
progress.clockwise = true
progress.center = view.center
progress.gradientRotateSpeed = 2
progress.roundedCorners = true
progress.glowMode = .Forward
progress.angle = 300
progress.setColors(UIColor.cyanColor() ,UIColor.whiteColor(), UIColor.magentaColor())
view.addSubview(progress)
```

## Installation
- It's on CocoaPods under the name (you guessed it!) KDCircularProgress
- Just drag `KDCircularProgress.swift` into your project. `Carthage` support is on To-do list.

### CocoaPods

KDCircularProgress is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'KDCircularProgress'
```

### Manually

Just drag `KDCircularProgress.swift` into your project.

### Carthage

`Carthage` support is on To-do list.


## Properties

####progressColors: `[UIColor]`
The colors used to generate the gradient of the progress. You can also set this using the variadic `setColors(UIColor...)` method. A gradient is used only if there is more than one color. A fill is used otherwise. The default is a white fill.

####angle: `Int`
The angle of the progress. Between 0 and 360 (inclusive). Simply change its value in order to change the visual progress of the component. Default is 0.

####startAngle: `Int`
The angle at which the progress will begin. Between 0 and 360 (inclusive), however you can pass any negative or positive values and the component will mod them automatically to the required range. Default is 0.

####clockwise: `Bool`
Clockwise if true, Counter-clockwise if false. Default is true.

####roundedCorners: `Bool`
When true, the ends of the progress track will be drawn with a half circle radius. Default is false.

####gradientRotateSpeed: `CGFloat`
Describes how many times the underlying gradient will perform a 2Ï€ rotation for each full cycle of the progress. Integer values recommended. Default is 0.

####glowAmount: `CGFloat`
The intensity of the glow. Between 0 and 1.0. Default is 1.0.

####glowMode: `KDCircularProgressGlowMode`
- **.Forward** - The glow increases proportionaly to the angle. No glow at 0 degrees and full glow at 360 degrees.

- **.Reverse** - The glow increases inversely proportional to the angle. Full glow at 0 degrees and no glow at 360 degrees.

- **.Constant** - Constant glow.

- **.NoGlow** - No glow

The default is **.Forward**

####progressThickness: `CGFloat`
The thickness of the progress. Between 0 and 1. Default is 0.4

####trackThickness: `CGFloat`
The thickness of the background track. Between 0 and 1. Default is 0.5

####trackColor: `UIColor`
The color of the background track. Default is `UIColor.blackColor()`.

####progressInsideFillColor: `UIColor`
The color of the center of the circle. Default is `UIColor.clearColor()`.

##Methods
```swift 
override public init(frame: CGRect)
```
Initialize with a frame. Please only use square frames.

```swift 
convenience public init(frame:CGRect, colors: UIColor...)
```
Initialize with a frame and the gradient colors.

```swift 
public func setColors(colors: UIColor...)
```

Set the colors for the progress gradient.

```swift
public func animateFromAngle(fromAngle: Int, toAngle: Int, duration: NSTimeInterval, relativeDuration: Bool = true, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?)
```

Animate the progress from an initial value to a final value, with a completion block that fires after the animation is done.

`relativeDuration` - specify if the duration is for the specific animation or is the duration that would make a full turn.

```swift
public func animateToAngle(toAngle: Int, duration: NSTimeInterval, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?)
```

Animate the progress from the current state to a target value.

```swift 
public func pauseAnimation()
```

Pause the animation, if any.

```swift 
public func isAnimating() -> Bool
```

Check if there's an active animation.

##Misc
Prefering light colors in the gradients gives better results. As mentioned before, use square frames. Rectangular frames are not tested and might produce unexpected results.

##To-Do
- [x] Add example project
- [ ] Carthage Support
- [x] CocoaPods Support
- [x] IBDesignable/IBInspectable support
- [X] Adding a `progress` property as an alternative to `angle`
- [ ] Clean up
